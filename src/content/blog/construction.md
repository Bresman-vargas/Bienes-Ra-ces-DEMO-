## The Role of Urban Planning

Urban planning is essential for shaping cities that are functional, sustainable, and inclusive. It involves designing infrastructure, transportation, and public spaces to enhance quality of life.

### Key Aspects of Urban Planning:

- **Sustainability**: Implementing eco-friendly solutions to reduce environmental impact.
- **Infrastructure Development**: Planning roads, utilities, and public facilities efficiently.
- **Zoning & Land Use**: Defining areas for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes.
- **Transportation Planning**: Enhancing mobility through public transit and walkable spaces.
- **Community Engagement**: Involving citizens in decision-making for inclusive development.

Effective urban planning ensures that cities evolve in a way that balances growth, accessibility, and environmental responsibility.
